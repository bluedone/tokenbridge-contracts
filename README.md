# POA bridge smart contracts
These contracts are the core of POA bridge functionality. They implement the logic to relay assests between
two EVM-based blockchain networks by collecting bridge validators signatures to approve relay operations.

Currently the contracts supports two types of relay operations:
* to tokenize native coins circulating in one blockchain network (Home) into an ERC20 token in another network (Foreign);
* to swap a token presented by an existing ERC20 contract in a Foreign network to an ERC20 token in the Home network, where one pair of bridge contracts correspond to one pair of ERC20 tokens.

This version of the contract is intended to be work with [the bridge process implemented on NodeJS](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-nodejs).
Please refer to the bridge process documentation to deploy and configure it.

POA bridge contracts consist of several main parts:
* The Home Bridge is a smart contract that should be deployed in POA.Network;
* The Foreign Bridge is a smart contract that should be deployed in Ethereum Mainnet;
* Depending on type of relay operations the following components are used as well:
  * in `NATIVE-TO-ERC` mode: the ERC20 token (in fact, ERC677 extension is used) should be deployed on Foreign network;
  * in `ERC-TO-ERC` mode: the ERC20 token (in fact, ERC677 extension is used) should be deployed on Home network;
* Validators is a smart contract that should be deployed in both the POA.Network and the Ethereum Mainnet.

Responsibilities and roles of the bridge:
- Administrator Role (representation of a multisig contract):
  - add/remove validators
  - set daily limits on both bridges
  - set maximum per transaction limit on both bridges
  - set minimum per transaction limit on both bridges
  - upgrade contracts in case of vulnerability
  - set minimum required signatures from validators in order to relay a user's transaction
- Validator Role :
  - provide 100% uptime to relay transactions
  - listen for `UserRequestForSignature` events on Home Bridge and sign an approval to relay assets on Foreign network;
  - listen for `CollectedSignatures` events on Home Bridge as soon enough signatures are collected and transfer all collected signatures to Foreign Bridge contact;
  - listen for `UserRequestForAffirmation` or `Transfer` (depending on the bridge mode) events on Foreign Bridge and send approval to Home Bridge to relay assets from Foreign Network to Home
- User role:
  - sends assets to Bridge contracts:
    - in `NATIVE-TO-ERC` mode: send native coins to the Home Bridge to receive ERC20 tokens from the Foreign Bridge, send ERC20 tokens to the Foreign Bridge to unlock native coins from the Home Bridge;
    - in `ERC-TO-ERC` mode: transfer ERC20 tokens to the Foreign Bridge to mint ERC20 tokens on the Home Network, transfer ERC20 tokens to the Home Bridge to unlock ERC20 tokens on Foreign networks.
