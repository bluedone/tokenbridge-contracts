# POA Bridge Smart Contracts
These contracts provide the core functionality for the POA bridge. They implement the logic to relay assests between two EVM-based blockchain networks. The contracts collect bridge validator's signatures to approve and facilitate relay operations. 

The POA bridge smart contracts are intended to work with [the bridge process implemented on NodeJS](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-nodejs).
Please refer to the bridge process documentation to configure and deploy the bridge.

## Summary

### Operations

Currently, the contracts support two types of relay operations:
* Tokenize the native coin in one blockchain network (Home) into an ERC20 token in another network (Foreign).
* Swap a token presented by an existing ERC20 contract in a Foreign network into an ERC20 token in the Home network, where one pair of bridge contracts corresponds to one pair of ERC20 tokens.


### Components

The POA bridge contracts consist of several components:
* The **Home Bridge** smart contract. This is currently deployed in POA.Network.
* The **Foreign Bridge** smart contract. This is deployed in the Ethereum Mainnet.
* Depending on the type of relay operations the following components are also used:
  * in `NATIVE-TO-ERC` mode: the ERC20 token (in fact, the ERC677 extension is used) is deployed on the Foreign network;
  * in `ERC-TO-ERC` mode: the ERC20 token (in fact, the ERC677 extension is used) is deployed on the Home network;
* The **Validators** smart contract is deployed in both the POA.Network and the Ethereum Mainnet.

### Bridge Roles and Responsibilities

Responsibilities and roles of the bridge:
- **Administrator** role (representation of a multisig contract):
  - add/remove validators
  - set daily limits on both bridges
  - set maximum per transaction limit on both bridges
  - set minimum per transaction limit on both bridges
  - upgrade contracts in case of vulnerability
  - set minimum required signatures from validators in order to relay a user's transaction
- **Validator** role:
  - provide 100% uptime to relay transactions
  - listen for `UserRequestForSignature` events on Home Bridge and sign an approval to relay assets on Foreign network
  - listen for `CollectedSignatures` events on Home Bridge. As soon as enough signatures are collected, transfer all collected signatures to the Foreign Bridge contract.
  - listen for `UserRequestForAffirmation` or `Transfer` (depending on the bridge mode) events on the Foreign Bridge and send approval to Home Bridge to relay assets from Foreign Network to Home
- **User** role:
  - sends assets to Bridge contracts:
    - in `NATIVE-TO-ERC` mode: send native coins to the Home Bridge to receive ERC20 tokens from the Foreign Bridge, send ERC20 tokens to the Foreign Bridge to unlock native coins from the Home Bridge;
    - in `ERC-TO-ERC` mode: transfer ERC20 tokens to the Foreign Bridge to mint ERC20 tokens on the Home Network, transfer ERC20 tokens to the Home Bridge to unlock ERC20 tokens on Foreign networks.
